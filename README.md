### hey there.
### my name is samuel, i'm a student in computer science.

#### things i like ✨
- 🎮 video games (rpg and fps primarily)
- 🎵 music (i listen to a wide variety of genres, but mostly j-pop, jazz-funk and rock)
- ✏️ art (i do traditional and digital drawing, but i'm more confortable with traditional)
- 💻 tinkering with my [computer's desktop environnement](./assets/desktop_screenshot.png) (i like having a config that truly represents how i work)
    - on a side note, i've wasted quite a bit of time with my config :
    > i've made a few scripts to handle switching wallpapers and used [matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen)
    > in order to have my whole desktop apply color theming corresponding
    > to the material 3 scheme.
