# Anby's Movies

**Anby's Movies** is a school project, in which the main focus was to create a
mobile app targeted at Android devices that relied upon an external API.

The API we had to use for this assignment was [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org).
As such, the main functionality that our app had to fulfill was to simply be able to
consult the [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org) catalog.

We were in a group of 3. Me, Lohan and Théo. Lohan worked on the backend and all
the functions for the data fetching and serialization into Kotlin data classes
(as well as a few activities). Théo focused on the implementation of a
favourites feature. As for me, I came up with most of the layouts and linked
everything together.
